--HOW TO SET UP:--

Approach your Unity VRC Avatar Scene. Open your Avatar's Parameters and add the Following Parameters, if not already present:

FLOAT : FW_P_Hours   DEFAULT VALUE : 1
FLOAT : FW_P_Minutes DEFAULT VALUE : 1
FLOAT : FW_P_Seconds DEFAULT VALUE : 1

Now Save And Build your Avatar.

Now Open VRChat and Get your Current OSC Port (DEFAULT 9000).
To Get it, Open your Radial Menu > Settings > OSC > Enable OSC & OSC Debug.

Inside the OSC Debug menu, it will print you the Port it uses, Write that port down somewhere!



--HOW TO RUN ON WINDOWS ü™ü :--

Open /Soft/dev/config.cfg, and edit the PORT to be whatever your OSC Port was in VRChat.
Save and exit, then Run "RUN OSC.exe".



--HOW TO RUN ON LINUX üêß :--

Wow! Look at you mister fancy, running linux!

Let me guess? Arch?
anyways, here's how to run it:

1) Open your Terminal

2) CD into the folder you moved the file, for example: 'cd ~/Downloads/ThisProduct/FA_OSC/'

3) Make the file executeable: 'chmod +x "RUN_OSC"' (you only have to do this step once, then never again)

4) Run it using './RUN_OSC'


You know, as a linux user, you need to know these things off the top of your head. Smh!



--EXTRAS:--

If you would like to change the frequency that the clock updates, you may set the TIME_BETWEEN_UPDATES,
to your preferred refresh interval. (milliseconds)
